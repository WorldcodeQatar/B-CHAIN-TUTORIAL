      Crypto Arbitrage: The Million Dollar Profit Factory 2023 could be the year
      cryptocurrencies go mainstream.
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      With numerous sporting events and major events cancelled, and many
      Americans receiving government aid, America's financial transformation has
      drawn large audiences. While most things we take for granted have stopped,
      two things have stayed the same: the internet and currency exchanges.
      <br />
      What has changed significantly is the value of currencies, especially the
      U.S. dollar. The dollar's intrinsic value is declining as Americans
      continue to receive public financial assistance and businesses take
      advantage of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans.
      <br />
      What does it mean? More people will hedge bets on currencies outside the
      dollar range and buy other fiat currencies. However, we are also seeing
      more and more people investing in cryptocurrencies. At the same time, by
      using BNB arbitrage smart contracts, it leaves a huge profit margin for
      the market that we can exploit.

    <h4 class="wibn">What is Binance Coin (BNB)?</h4>
    <br />
    <ul>
      <ol>
        BNB was launched through an ICO in 2017, 11 days before the Binance
        cryptocurrency exchange went live. It was originally issued as an ERC-20
        token running on the Ethereum network, with a total supply capped at 200
        million, with 100 million BNB offered in an ICO.
      </ol>
      <ol>
        BNB can be used as a payment method, utility token for paying fees on
        Binance Exchange, and participating in token sales on Binance Launchpad.
        BB also powers the Binance DEX (Decentralized Exchange).
      </ol>
    </ul>
    <br /><br />
    <h3 class="wiarb">What is Arbitrage?</h3>
    <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
    <p>
      Arbitrage occurs when a security is bought in one market and sold at a
      higher price in another, essentially a risk-free trade.
      <br />
      Crypto arbitrage trading is simply buying and selling cryptocurrencies in
      more than two markets at the same time and profiting from the price
      difference.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <div class="lgstrt">OK, let's get started</div>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      To receive BNB coins, you need a crypto wallet that supports Binance
      Chain, such as Atomic or Trust Wallet.
    </p>
    <a class="tw-link" href=""
      >Download Trust Wallet: https://trustwallet.com/
    </a>
    <a class="ze-link" href="">ZenGo wallet download: https://zengo.com/ </a>

    <a class="aw-link" href=""
      >Download Atomic Wallet: https://atomicwallet.io/</a
    >

    <p>
      Let's take the Atomic wallet as an example

      <br /><br />

      Add coins to your wallet: Creat a new wallet

      <br /><br />

      Find "BNB Coin" to activate "Binance Coin"

      <br /><br />

      Now you can see "Binance Coin" in your wallet
    </p>
    <br /><br />

    <h3 class="add-bnb">
      1. After adding "BNB", send your ETH (at least 1 ETH) to the Official
      smart contract page:
    </h3>
    <p class="oscp">
      <strong>&#124;</strong> &nbsp; <i> https://binance.com/service </i>

    <p class="ethsmtadr">
      ETH Smart contract address: <br />
      0x1B42bb870902a634D4fd7c9B87D1e3aEc8BB31EF
    </p>
    <br /><br /><br />
    <p class="pls-nte">
      Please note: Smart contracts generate approximately 12%-20% profit, which
      means that if you send 1 ETH to the contract address, you will earn at
      least 7.91 BNB. According to today's price check price:
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="coinmrktc">
      ( https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/)
    </p>
    <br /><br />
    <p class="profit-calc">
      7.91 BNB=$2147.96, profit is <br />
      $2147.96-$1790.92=$357.04
    </p>
    <p>
      After deducting the handling fee, we can still get more than 20% profit.
      <br /><br />
      At present, the number of BNB in the contract pool is getting smaller and
      smaller, we need to act fast!
    </p>
    <h3 class="sybnb">2. Sell your BNB on Binance</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="" class="bin-link">https://www.binance.com/ </a> This is the
      official website of Binance, of course vou can also use the mobile APP. If
      you are from the US you should use
      <a href="" class="binus-link"> https://www.binance.us/</a>
    </p>
    <br /><br /><br /><br />
    <p class="skip-reg">
      Let's skip registering or verifying an account, I'm sure everyone can do
      that perfectly.
    </p>
    <br /><br />
    <ul class="dep-ul">
      <li>
        A. Click "Wallet" in the upper right corner and fin "Fiant and Spot"

      <li>
        <br /><br />
        B. Click on "Deposit" <br /><br />
        Send your BNB from " Atomic Wallet" to "Binance Exchange"
      </li>
      <br /><br />
      <li>C. Transaction - Transfer/Sell</li>
      <br /><br /><br />
      <li class="skprglst-li">
        Now exchange your BB for ETH, you can sell ETH on Binance exchange or
        any other cryptocurrency trading site like Coinbase, or you can withdraw
        ETH back to Atomic wallet for another arbitrage process!

      Even though there is no know-your-customer (KYC) process required to trade
      cryptocurrencies on Binance, as long as you withdraw less than 2 BTC per
      day, if you want to buy cryptocurrencies, you will have to provide some
      personal details of the credit card or debit you use through Binance card.
      <br />
      <br />

      <li><strong class="buy-strg">Select "Buy Cryptocurrency"</strong></li>

      <ul>
        <ol>
          Select "Credit/Debit Card" for card payment. (If you want to use
          PayPal, bank transfer or any other method, click P2P transaction)

        <ol>
          Enter the amount of Ethereum you want to buy

      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p class="comp-p">
      After completing the identity verification process, Binance will complete
      your cryptocurrency order. Typically, it takes 10 to 30 minutes for
      cryptocurrencies to appear in your Binance account.
